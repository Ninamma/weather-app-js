# My 1235098th time attempting this weather app

This will hopefully grow to be an app for people to quickly find out if they need to wear more or less clothes than yesterday... :grimacing:

Initially tried using ClojureScript & Clojure, but struggled with new languages and new concepts at the same time, so decided to start again with JS instead.

## Make It Do
So to find out how today's weather will compare to yesterday's, you basically just need to:

#### Start the client
From the root directory:
```
cd client
npm start
```

### Start the server.
Again from the root directory:
```
cd server
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and there you'll be told about today's fate! :crystal_ball:
